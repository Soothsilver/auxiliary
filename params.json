{"name":"Auxiliary","tagline":"Auxiliary 2D library for XNA. Feel free to ask me for help using it, if necessary.","body":"\"Auxiliary\" is an XNA library of classes and functions. It consists of two parts: The main \"Auxiliary\" class library that works only with XNA 4, and the \"Cother\" class library which consists of general C# classes not requiring XNA. The primary aim of the Auxiliary library is to help you develop simple XNA Windows games faster, eliminating much of the legwork you must normally do. For example, the Auxiliary library has a static class called \"Primitives\" with methods such as \"DrawRectangle\", \"DrawAndFillRoundedRectangle\" or \"DrawMultiLineText\" which allow you to draw graphics primitives. Besides some auxiliary functions it has, the other important part of the library is its system of GamePhases. These will allow you to layer parts of your UI on top of each other, drawing all of them, but allowing the user to interact only with the topmost. Typically, you would have a \"MainIngamePhase\" which would do most of the work, but on top of that, you could have a \"SelectABuildingPhase\" which is a dialog window that prompts the user to choose a building to create. You would want the user to see both the main game map in the background and the new window in the front. Auxiliary supports this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
